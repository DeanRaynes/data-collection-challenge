# data-collection-challenge

This repository contains my 2 jupyter notebooks for my data collection from the Mars news and mars temperature site.  Within the Mars folder you will find the 2 jupyter notebooks and the csv that is df created from the temperature data webscraping.  All of the needed libraries are listed at the top.  I found that I had to use the selenium webdriver rather then the splinter library from selenium.
